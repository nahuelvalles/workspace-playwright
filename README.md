Project Description:
This repository contains an end-to-end automated test suite for the Qubika Sports Club Management System. It utilizes Playwright and TypeScript to automate both API and UI workflows within the same test. 

Test Workflow
The test suite covers the following steps:

-Create a new user through the API:
-A POST request is sent to create a new user. The user information is saved for subsequent steps.
-Navigate to the Qubika Sports Club Management System:
-Open the login page and validate its elements.
-Use the previously created user's credentials to log in.

Post-login actions:
-Access the Category page.
-Create a new category and validate its successful creation.
-Create a subcategory and confirm its presence in the Categories list.

Installation

Clone repo: https://github.com/nahuelvalles/Qubika-playwright.git

In terminal execute:
	npm install
	npx playwright install
	npm install --save-dev playwright
	npm install --save-dev selenium-webdriver

Potential Improvements
* Test Parallelization: Further optimize test execution time by running more tests in parallel.
* API Mocking: Consider implementing mocks for APIs to handle edge cases in isolation.
